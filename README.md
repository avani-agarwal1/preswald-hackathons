Welcome to the **Preswald Data App Hackathon**—your opportunity to transform Python scripts into interactive, shareable data applications using Preswald's innovative platform. Whether you're a data scientist, analyst, or developer, this hackathon is your chance to showcase your skills and creativity.

## 🚀 What is Preswald?

Preswald is a static-site generator that allows you to build interactive data apps in Python. It packages compute, data access, and UI into self-contained apps that run locally in the browser. Built on a WASM runtime with Pyodide and DuckDB, Preswald enables portable, file-based apps that are fast, reactive, and shareable.

### 🔑 Key Features

- **Code-based development:** Write apps in Python without needing JavaScript frameworks.  
- **File-first approach:** One command creates a fully-packaged `.html` app.  
- **Built-in UI components:** Utilize tables, charts, forms, and more.  
- **Reactive engine:** Efficiently updates only what's necessary.  
- **Local execution:** Runs offline, even with large datasets.  
- **AI-ready:** Apps are fully inspectable and modifiable by agents.  

## 🌍 Hackathon Theme: *"Data Apps for Impact"*

Create interactive data applications that provide insights, solve problems, or tell compelling stories. Your app should be built using Preswald and can focus on areas such as:

- Public health data visualization  
- Financial dashboards  
- Educational tools  
- Environmental monitoring  
- Any domain where data can drive impact  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
